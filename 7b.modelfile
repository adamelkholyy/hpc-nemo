Below is the CTS-R (Cognitive Therapy Scale-Revised) manual for assessing therapist competencies in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Remember the scoring schema as you will be asked to assess a therapy transcript shortly.

Start of CTS-R manual.
Manual of the Revised Cognitive Therapy Scale (CTS-R) 
Introduction 
This is a scale for measuring therapist competence in Cognitive Therapy and is based on the original Cognitive Therapy Scales (CTS, Young & Beck, 1980, 1988). The CTS-R was developed jointly by clinicians and researchers at the Newcastle Cognitive and Behavioural Therapies Centre and the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. The CTS-R contains 12 items, in contrast to earlier versions of the CTS which contained either 13 (Young & Beck, 1980) or 11 (Young & Beck, 1988). The development of the revised scale, together with the psychometric properties, is described in the appendices.

Theoretical Bases of the Scale 

Two frameworks underpin the revised scale, the Cognitive Cycle and the Dreyfus Scale of Competence (Dreyfus, 1989). The Cognitive Cycle: The cognitive cycle represented in Figure 1 demonstrates how the CTS-R items address specific cognitive features. At the heart of the scale, as in therapy, is the conceptualisation. In order to move the patient from a dysfunctional cycle, dominated by a dysfunctional conceptualisation, the therapist must address the four features highlighted in the outer ring of the circle: thoughts, feelings, physiology and behaviour/planning. In terms of therapeutic competence, the therapist's must be skilled at encouraging the patient to move around the points of the cycle, using the Cognitive Specific items (Items 6-12) to address the features. To facilitate the smooth movement around the cycle, the therapist must also demonstrate competence in areas assessed by the remaining items 1-5 (agenda & adherence, feedback, collaboration, pacing, interpersonal effectiveness). 

Dreyfus Model of Competence: The Dreyfus Model has also been incorporated within the CTS-R. It is designed to assess the level of competence shown by the therapist (see Table 2). In the original Dreyfus scale there are five levels, to this we added a further level to denote 'incompetence', as outlined below. 

Table 2: Adapted Dreyfus Level of Competence 
Incompetent - The therapist commits errors and displays poor and unacceptable behaviour, leading to negative therapeutic consequences. 
Novice - At this level the therapist displays a rigid adherence to taught rules and is unable to take account of situational factors. He/she is not yet showing any discretionary judgement. 
Advanced Beginner - The therapist treats all aspects of the task separately and gives equal importance to them. There is evidence of situational perspective and discretionary judgement. 
Competent - The therapist is able to see the tasks linked within a conceptual framework. He/she makes plans within this framework and uses standardised and routinised procedures. 
Proficient - The therapist sees the patient's problems holistically, prioritises tasks and is able to make quick decisions. The therapist is clearly skilled and able. 
Expert - The therapist no longer uses rules, guidelines or maxims. He/she has deep tacit understanding of the issues and is able to use novel problem-solving techniques. The skills are demonstrated even in the face of difficulties (e.g. excessive avoidance). 
This model has been incorporated within the scoring system as demonstrated in the scoring layout below. 

Scoring system 
A detailed explanation of the scoring system is provided below. As you can see, each item is rated on a Likert scale, ranging from 0-6. Each level being defined in detail to conform to the levels of competence (see Table 2). 

Example of the scoring layout: 

Key features: this is an operationalised description of the item (see examples within the CTS-R). 

Competence level Examples 
0 = Absence of feature, or highly inappropriate performance 
1 = Inappropriate performance, with major problems evident 
2 = Evidence of competence, but numerous problems and lack of consistency 
3 = Competent, but some problems and/or inconsistencies 
4 = Good features, but minor problems and/or inconsistencies 
5 = Very good features, minimal problems and/or inconsistencies 
6 = Excellent performance, or very good even in the face of patient difficulties 

Please note that the top marks (i.e. near the 'expert' end of the continuum) are reserved for those therapists demonstrating highly effective skills, particularly in the face of difficulties (i.e. highly aggressive or avoidant patients; high levels of emotional discharge from the patients; and various situational factors). Maximum score on the scale is 72 (12 x 6). At the Newcastle Cognitive Therapy Centre we set a minimum competence standard of 36, which would be an average of 3 marks per item. 

Item 1 - Agenda Setting and Adherence 
Introduction
The agenda helps ensure that the most important issues are addressed in an efficient manner. Therapist and patient must establish these issues jointly. The agenda should review items from the previous session(s), in particular the homework assignment, and include one or two items for the session. Once set, it should be appropriately adhered to. However, if changes are necessary, because of an important new issue arising, the deviation from the agenda should be made explicit. 

The key features of the 'agenda' is outlined in the CTS-R Rating Scale as follows: 
Key features: To address adequately topics that have been agreed and set in an appropriate way. This involves the setting of discrete and realistic targets collaboratively. The format for setting the agenda may vary according to the stage of therapy - see manual. Three features need to be considered when scoring this item: 
(i) presence/absence of an agenda which is explicit, agreed and prioritised, and feasible in the time available; 
(ii) appropriateness of the contents of the agenda (to stage of therapy, current concerns etc.), a standing item being a review of the homework set previously;
(iii) appropriate adherence to the agenda. 

NB: Agenda setting requires collaboration and credit for this should be given here, and here alone. Collaboration occurring at any other phase of the session should be scored under Item 3 (Collaboration).

Short-term cognitive therapy requires that the important issues are discussed sensitively but managed in a business-like way. In order to cover a lot of material adequately in a relatively short space of time, specific and realistic targets need to be set in a collaborative manner, and adhered to appropriately. Indeed, it is of limited use to set a good agenda and then not be guided by it. On setting the agenda the therapist must ensure the items are appropriate. They should be suitable for the stage of therapy, amenable to a CT rationale, consistent with the formulation, and conceived to take the therapy forward. In addition, the items should be clear and discrete. If the items are too vague, this may lead to confusion and also result in divergent and tangential material being discussed. It is important to note, however, that the therapist must be aware not to let the patient go into too much detail about any one item at this stage, as this will disrupt the agenda setting process. The therapist must be careful not to include too many items, as this may lead to either important items being missed or the therapy being rushed. 

The list of items should include material from both the patient and therapist. A discussion of the homework which was set previously should be a 'standing' item. Even when no homework was set in the previous session (for whatever reason), the value of such assignments should be discussed in order to restate the importance of this aspect of therapy. Unless this is done the patient may come to think that there is no need to complete the assignment carefully. Part of socialising the patient to CT is to establish an expectation that he/she will need to come to each session having thought through the key topics for that day's therapeutic work. 

Following the setting of the agenda, the patient should be asked to prioritise his/her list of items. The prioritisation permits the therapist to plan the session and allot appropriate time for the material. Efficient prioritising facilitates the pacing of the therapy.
 
CHECKLIST: QUESTIONS FOR RATERS TO ASK THEMSELVES:
1. Did the therapist set an agenda with clear, discrete, and realistic goals - and adhere to it? 
2. Can you identify at least two specific agenda items? 
3. Was the patient encouraged to participate in setting the agenda? 
4. Do you think the patient clearly understood what the therapy was going to cover? 
5. Did the agenda seem appropriate? 
6. Were the items prioritised? 
7. Was the session set sensitively? 
8. Did you hear any of the following: 
- What would you like to get from today's session? 
- As usual at the beginning of the session, we need to set a plan. 
- What benefits do you think we get by setting the agenda? 
- Perhaps we need to put some time for X. 
- What is the most important thing to cover today? ... Are there any other things to include? 
- Is there anything that has been troubling you this week, which might help to illustrate your problems? 
- You have mentioned X, Y and Z. Which of these would you like to talk about first? 
- If we did discuss this item, how would it help take the therapy forward? 
- What would be most helpful to discuss today, keeping in mind the stage we’re at in therapy? 
- By discussing X, how will this help us move forward? 

Item 2 - Feedback 
Introduction
The therapist should both provide and elicit feedback throughout each session. The therapist's feedback should occur at regular intervals and is particularly important at the end of the therapy session. This feedback helps to focus the patient on the main therapeutic issues, and assists in reducing vague or amorphous issues into manageable units. It also helps both the therapist and the patient to determine whether they have a shared understanding of the problems and concerns. Eliciting feedback ensures that the patient understands the therapist's interventions, formulations and lines of reasoning. It also allows the individual to express positive and negative reactions regarding the therapy. 

The key features of 'feedback' is outlined in the CTS-R Rating Scale as follows: 
Key features: The patient's and therapist's understanding of key issues should be helped through the use of two-way feedback. The two major forms of feeding back information are through general summary and chunking of important units of information. The use of appropriate feedback helps both the therapist to understand the patient's situation, and the patient to synthesise material enabling him/her to gain major insight and make therapeutic shifts. It also helps to keep the patient focused. Three features need to be considered when scoring this item: 
(i) Presence and frequency, or absence, of feedback. Feedback should be given/elicited throughout the therapy – with major summaries both at the beginning (review of week) and end (session summary), while topic reviews (i.e. chunking) should occur throughout the session; 
(ii) Appropriateness of the contents of the feedback;
(iii) Manner of its delivery and elicitation (NB: can be written). This item stresses the importance of two-way feedback. By 'summarising' and 'chunking' information at  regular intervals, the therapist can emphasise the major features, synthesise new material and highlight issues that require further clarification. By eliciting the patient's feedback (thoughts and feelings)  regarding the therapy, the therapist can check the patient's attitude, knowledge base and understanding. Chunking information and eliciting feedback should occur frequently. On occasions, when either particularly important or confusing material is being discussed, the feedback should occur after each major point; this can also help 'contain' distressing issues. During normal short-term CT, the two-way feedback should occur at least every 10 minutes. Major summaries should occur at the beginning and end of each session, to help reinforce and consolidate therapeutic material. It is important that the feedback be appropriate. For example, when providing feedback the therapist must choose the salient material presented to him her, and then summarise these features in a way that both clarifies and highlights key issues. This form of summarising and feeding back is the foundation for many forms of cognitive techniques (e.g. Socratic questioning). When eliciting feedback, the therapist should be aware that patients (especially people suffering from depression) often indicate understanding simply out of compliance. Hence, it is vital that the therapist explores the patient's understanding and attitude towards the therapy carefully. The manner in which the feedback is elicited and delivered is also important. For example, the therapist should be sensitive to negative and covert reactions expressed both verbally and non-verbally by the patient, and should also ask for the patient's thoughts when such clues are noticed. Whenever appropriate the therapist should ask the patient either for suggestions about how to proceed, or to choose among alternative courses of action. 

When giving feedback the therapist should deliver it in a manner that is constructive and helps to move the therapy forward. This will involve anticipation of how the information may be received (e.g. perceived as criticism). 
CHECKLIST: QUESTIONS FOR RATERS TO ASK THEMSELVES:
1. Do you think the feedback was appropriate? ... Sufficiently frequent? 
2. Did the therapist chunk the salient pieces of information to provide a platform for new insight? 
3. Was the patient encouraged to provide feedback throughout the session? 
4. Do you think that the feedback was used effectively in helping the patient's understanding? 
5. Did you hear any of the following: 
- Could you tell me the three most important issues we've discussed today? 
- Just to summarise, at the beginning of the session we spoke about X and the effect it had on your feelings. Then we discussed Y, etc. etc. 
- I think I have understood what you just said, let me see if I can repeat back the main points. 
- Could you tell me whether I’ve got that right? 
- Is there anything that I’ve said, that didn’t make sense? 
- What was the most/lease helpful thing that we discussed today? 

Item 3 - Collaboration 
Introduction
Good therapeutic teamwork is a fundamental feature of cognitive therapy. Collaboration should be consistent throughout the session, although at times didactic approaches may be necessary (e.g. educating the patient about the physical effects of anxiety). The key features of 'collaboration' is outlined in the CTS-R Rating Scale as follows: Key features: The patient should be encouraged to be active in the session. There must be clear evidence of productive teamwork, with the therapist skilfully encouraging the patient to participate fully (e.g. through questioning techniques, shared problem solving and decision making) and take responsibility. However, the therapist must not allow the patient to ramble in an unstructured way. Three features need to be considered: the therapist style should encourage effective teamwork through his/her use of: 
(i) verbal skills (e.g. non-hectoring); 
(ii) non-verbal skills (e.g. attention and use of joint activities); 
(iii) sharing of written summaries. 
NB: Questioning is a central feature with regard to this item, but questions designed to facilitate reflections and self discovery should be scored under Item 9 (Guided Discovery). As mentioned above, collaboration will be used during Agenda Setting (Item 1) and should be credited accordingly within this item. Hence, credit on this item should only be given for evidence of collaboration that occurs without Agenda Setting. 

The therapist should adopt a style that promotes an egalitarian relationship, whereby he/she and the patient work actively towards shared goals. This is achieved by the development of a 'teamwork' approach. Hence the therapist should avoid being overly directive, too intellectual, controlling or passive. The therapist needs to strike a balance between being structured on the one hand and on the other allowing the patient to make choices and take responsibility. In order to achieve a good therapeutic alliance, the therapist must assess the patient's needs, and particularly his/her preferred modes of learning. For example, Beck (1983) suggests that individuals who display sociotropic traits respond better to a warm supportive therapeutic relationships, while those with autonomous traits prefer to take a high level of responsibility within the therapy and respond better to a more task-oriented approach. Good Collaboration will also involve striking a balance between the verbal and non-verbal features. For example, deciding when to talk and when to listen; when to confront and when to back-off; when to offer suggestions and when to wait for the patient to devise his/her own. Another important element of Collaboration is for the therapist to be open about the process and status of therapy. This will include the therapist explaining the rationale for interventions, admitting confusion; sharing summaries both verbally and in writing. 

CHECKLIST: QUESTIONS FOR RATERS TO ASK THEMSELVES:
1. Was the patient encouraged to participate fully as a team member? 
2. Was the therapist able to establish a collaborative relationship? 
3. Did the therapist give the patient sufficient space and time to think? 
4. Was the therapist overly directive or too controlling? 
5. Did you hear any of the following: 
- How might we test that out? 
- Perhaps we could work out together an alternative way of looking at this issue. 
- Before setting this behavioural task, let's both examine the potential obstacles which might prevent us learning anything from it. 
- That's a difficult one, so let's put our heads together and try and think it through. 
- Could you help me make sense of this? 
- I’m sure that together we can work this one out. 
- Let’s look at this together. 
- You’re the expert with respect to your problem, so could you help me understand? 
- You’ve got your homework, so would you like me to do anything for next week? 

Item 4 - Pacing and Efficient Use of Time 
Introduction
The therapist should make optimal use of the time in accordance with items set in the agenda. He/she must maintain sufficient control, limit discussion of peripheral issues, interrupt unproductive discussion, and pace the session appropriately. Nevertheless, the therapist should avoid rushing crucial features of the session. The key features of 'Pacing and efficient use of time' is outlined in the CTS-R Rating Scale as follows: 

Key features: The session should be well 'time managed' in relation to the agenda, with the session flowing smoothly through discrete start, middle, and concluding phases. The work must be paced well in relation to the patient's needs, and while important issues need to be followed, unproductive digressions should be dealt with smoothly. The session should not go over time, without good reason. 
Three features need to be considered: 
(i) The degree to which the session flows smoothly through the discrete phases; 
(ii) The appropriateness of the pacing throughout the session; 
(iii) The degree of fit to the learning speed of the patient.
The session should be well time managed, such that it is neither too slow nor too quick. For example, the therapist may unwittingly belabour a point after the patient has already grasped the message, or may gather much more data than is necessary before formulating a strategy for change. In these cases, the sessions can seem painfully slow and inefficient. On the other hand, the therapist may switch from topic to topic too rapidly, thus not allowing the patient to integrate the new material sufficiently. The therapist may also intervene before having gathered enough data to conceptualise the problem. In summary, if the therapy is conducted too slowly or too quickly, it may impede therapeutic change and could de-motivate the patient. The pacing of the material should always be accommodated to the patient's needs and speed of learning. For example, when there is evidence of difficulties (e.g. emotional or cognitive difficulties), more time and attention may need to be given. In such circumstances the agenda items may be shuffled or adapted accordingly. In some extreme circumstances (e.g. disclosure of suicidal thoughts), the structure and pacing of the session will need to change drastically in accordance with the needs of the situation. The therapy should move through discrete phases. At the start, there should be a structured agenda. Then the agreed plan of the session should be handled efficiently during the main phase. It is important that the therapist maintains an overview of the session to allow correct pacing throughout. This may involve the therapist politely interrupting peripheral discussion and directing the patient back to the agenda. A well paced session should not need to exceed the time allocated for the period and should cover the items set in the agreed agenda. It will also allow sufficient time for the homework task to be set appropriately, and not be unduly rushed. 

CHECKLIST: QUESTIONS FOR RATERS TO ASK THEMSELVES:
1. Was the therapist able to recognise the patient's need and adapt the session accordingly? 
2. Was there any time during the session when the session moved too slowly/quickly (e.g. agenda setting phase)? 
3. Do you think the session flowed well overall? 
4. Was the therapist able to avoid unproductive digressions? 
5. Was there sufficient time left for the homework assignment? 
6. Was the pacing of the session adapted well to the needs of the patient? 
7. Did the patient appear rushed? 
8. Did you hear any of the following: 
- How much time should we spend on that item? 
- Do you mind stopping a second, you've given me lots of information already. Just to make sure I have understood completely, let's look at the major points you’ve made. 
- We may have strayed off the topic a little, shall we get back and focus on the chief issues you raised. 
- Now we have 20 minutes left before the end of the session. Is there anything you think we must cover before the end - keeping in mind that we will also need to set the homework assignment? 
- Do you think we should move off this topic now? 

Item 5 - Interpersonal Effectiveness 
Introduction
The ability of the therapist to form a good relationship with the patient is deemed crucial to the therapy. Indeed, in order for the patient to be able to disclose difficult material, there must be both trust and confidence in the therapist. Rogers suggests that the non-specific factors of 'empathy, genuineness and warmth' are key features of effective therapy. The key features of 'Interpersonal Effectiveness' is outlined in the CTS-R Rating Scale as follows: 

Key features: The patient is put at ease by the therapist’s verbal and non-verbal (e.g. listening skills) behaviour. The patient should feel that the core conditions (i.e. warmth, genuineness, empathy and understanding) are present. However, it is important to keep professional boundaries. In situations where the therapist is extremely interpersonally effective, he/she is creative, insightful and inspirational. 
Three features need to be considered: 
(i) empathy - the therapist is able to understand and enter the patient's feelings imaginatively and uses this understanding to promote change; 
(ii) genuineness - the therapist has established a trusting working relationship; 
(iii) warmth - the patient seems to feel liked and accepted by the therapist. 
In order that the appropriate levels of the three features are conveyed, careful judgement is required from the therapist. Personal and contextual needs must be taken into account. For example, towards the end of therapy lower levels of warmth may be used, as compared to the beginning, in order to promote patient disengagement. Empathy concerns the therapist's ability to make the patient aware that their difficulties are recognised and understood on both an emotional and cognitive level. The therapist needs to show that he/she shares the patient's feelings imaginatively. For example, the promotion of a shared-value system between therapist and patient will help to enhance this aspect of the relationship. The therapist should avoid appearing distant, aloof or critical. A good therapist should adopt a genuine and straightforward therapeutic style. A sincere and open style will promote a trusting, collaborative working relationship. The therapist should avoid appearing condescending or patronising. It is also important for the therapist to convey warmth and concern through both his/her verbal and non-verbal behaviour. The therapist should avoid being critical, disapproving, impatient or cold. He/she should convey an attitude of acceptance of the person, but not of course with respect to the style of thinking. It is important to highlight that appropriate use of humour can often help to establish and maintain a good therapeutic relationship. 

CHECKLIST: QUESTIONS FOR RATERS TO ASK THEMSELVES:
I. Did you consider the relationship was positive? 
2. Was the therapist displaying appropriate empathy, understanding, warmth and genuineness? 
3. Did he/she appear appropriately genuine, helping to facilitate therapeutic trust? 
4. Do you think he/she showed acceptance and liking of the individual, while remaining within professional boundaries? 
5. Did the therapist appear confident? 
6. Did the therapist empathise with the patient’s distress? 
7. Did the therapist acknowledge any difficulties? 
8. Did you hear any of the following: 
- I understand that X was difficult for you to do 
- Shared laughter 
- This must have felt awful for you 
- You’ve made a great effort here. Thank you. 
- Despite the huge difficulties, you did really well. 
- Many people would feel that way, but you have decided to do something about it. 

Item 6 - Eliciting Appropriate Emotional Expression 
Introduction
The ability of the therapist to deal effectively with the emotional content of the therapy session is a crucial feature of therapy. The therapist should be able to increase or reduce the emotional ambience of a session through his her verbal and non-verbal behaviour. The therapist should then be able to use the patient's emotions to promote therapeutic change. The current item reflects the degree to which the therapist is able to create the circumstances through which emotional change and expression can be elicited and then used effectively.
 
Key features: The therapist facilitates the processing of appropriate levels of emotion by the patient. Emotional levels that are too high or too low are likely to interfere with therapy. The therapist must also be able to deal effectively with emotional issues which interfere with effective change (e.g. hostility, anxiety, excessive anger). Effective facilitation will enable the patient to access and express his/her emotions in a way that facilitates change. 
Three features have to be considered: 
(i) facilitation of access to a range of emotions; 
(ii) appropriate use and containment of emotional expression; 
(iii) facilitation of emotional expression, encouraging appropriate access and differentiation of emotions.

Cognitive therapy requires both cognitive and emotional shift. In order to produce emotional change the therapist must first facilitate the patient to express himself/herself on an emotional level. The therapist should ensure that emotions associated with a particular situation or cognition are elicited and assessed for intensity. The therapist must also be able to assess the emotional shift within a session and work with it accordingly; increasing and decreasing the level of emotionality as appropriate (see Figure 6.1). There is an optimal level of emotional affect required to motivate a person to change constructively. Too little emotional energy (i.e. apathy, lack of motivation, avoidance) will be insufficient to create change. In these cases the therapist must first be able to stimulate the patient (through verbal and non-verbal behaviour) to become an active participant in the therapeutic process. On the other hand too much emotion (i.e. anger, despair, fear, etc.) will interfere with therapy. The therapist should be able to contain the energy, or use or dissipate it, in order that it no longer serves as an obstacle to effective change. 

A skilled therapist will also recognise inconsistency between the emotional and cognitive content, and explore such discrepancies accordingly. For example, if a patient expresses no distressful emotion when talking about some unpleasant event, careful questioning
will help the patient access his/her associated emotions. 

CHECKLIST: QUESTIONS FOR RATERS TO ASK THEMSELVES:
1. Did the therapist pay sufficient attention to the person's emotions? 
2. Did the therapist help the patient to differentiate between different emotions? 
3. Did the therapist raise emotional topics in a sensitive manner? 
4. Was there an optimal level of emotional arousal to promote change? 
5. Did the therapist's activity serve to motivate the patient appropriately? 
6. Did the therapist prepare the patient to work on his/her emotions? 
7. Was the therapist able to contain any emotional outbursts? 
8. Did you hear any of the following: 
- How did that make you feel? 
- On a scale of 1 to 100, how would rate your feelings? 
- You seem very distressed today? Am I right? 
- If you tried to do that, how would it make you feel? 
- How does it feel when your recalling that event? 
- You appear to be fearful of talking about that subject. I'm sorry, but I’d like to press you a little more. 
- Did you feel anything else than sadness? 
- You are relating very distressing events, and you are smiling. How do you understand this? 

Item 7 - Eliciting Key Cognitions 
Introduction
Cognitive therapy stresses the role of cognitions and the emotions associated with them in the genesis and maintenance of a range of psychiatric disorders. The current feature addresses the ability of the therapist to elicit important cognitions in an effective manner. It is important to note that there are a number of techniques used frequently to elicit key cognitions, for example thought monitoring (e.g. thought eliciting diaries) and downward arrowing techniques. Such methods should be scored under this item rather than Item 11 (Application of Change Methods). The latter item is concerned with change techniques. The key features of 'Eliciting Key Cognitions' is outlined in the CTS-R Rating Scale as follows: 

Key features: To help the patient gain access to his/her cognitions (thoughts, assumptions and beliefs) and to understand the relationship between these and their distressing emotions. This can be done though the use of questioning, diaries and monitoring procedures. 
Three features need to be considered: 
(i) eliciting cognitions that are associated with distressing emotions (i.e. selecting key cognitions or hot thoughts); 
(ii) the skilfulness and breadth of the methods used (i.e. Socratic questioning; appropriate monitoring, downward arrowing, imagery, role-plays, etc.); 
(iii) choosing the appropriate level of work for the stage of therapy (i.e. automatic thoughts, assumptions, or core beliefs). 
NB: This item is concerned with the general work done with eliciting cognitions and emotions. If any specific cognitive or behavioural change methods are used, they should be scored under item 11 (Application of Change Methods).A therapist should be able to identify and elicit those thoughts, images and beliefs which are fundamental to the patient's distress (i.e. the key cognitions). Key cognitions often take the form of negative automatic self-statements or beliefs relating to the self and the world that either drive or maintain negative emotions. 
In the case of depression, such negative automatic thoughts (NATs) might be: 
- No one could ever love me, I'll always be rejected. 
- My future is bleak, and it will always be this way. } DEPRESSION
In panic with agoraphobia: 
- I’m having a heart attack } FEAR & ANXIETY - Unless I‘m very careful, I'll collapse. 
In PTSD: 
- The world is a hostile place, I'm never quite sure when the next thing will go wrong. 
- I can’t cope with things like I used to. } ANXIETY
Other types of key cognitions are dysfunctional core beliefs (core schemata, Early Maladaptive Schemata). These are rigid, inflexible and dysfunctional self-beliefs which are not open to the 'normal' corrective processes of logical thinking. These can be expressed through basic assumptions and rules (If ... then; I should ...; people should...). 

The negative automatic thoughts, basic assumptions, rules and core beliefs often exist in the face of overwhelming contradictory evidence (e.g. The eminent professor who thinks she is worthless). As part of the assessment, it is also important for the therapist to determine the different forms of cognitive biases being used to support the patient's thinking. For example, the patient may be engaging in 'minimising the positive': reducing the frequency or impact of good events, perhaps even focusing on the negative side of 
such events (e.g. "Now that I've got a new job, I'll have to get up early") OR, 'catastrophising': exaggerating the potential negative impact of an occurrence out of all reasonable proportions (e.g. "Mark didn’t call last night, I don't think he likes me any more"). Other cognitive biases include: overgeneralising, black and white (absolute) thinking, etc. 
 
On certain occasions the patient may display a great deal of emotion (cry, shake, etc.) while discussing issues. At such times, the patient's thinking needs to be checked-out as he/she may be experiencing dysfunctional thoughts at that moment (such thoughts are termed 'hot cognitions'). During such an episode, the therapist must exercise a great deal of empathy and skill when eliciting these cognitions. the therapist should also be able to elicit the key cognitions, when they are not immediately apparent. The therapist needs to use his her professional judgement in determining which are the 'key' cognitions, taking into account both the needs of the patient and the stage of therapy. For example, during the first few sessions it is not usually appropriate to elicit and tackle core beliefs, because the patient will not be sufficiently socialised to the therapy for effective work to be done.

Item 8 - Eliciting Behaviours 
Introduction
Behavioural problems are observed frequently in psychiatric disorders. They take numerous forms, including withdrawal, avoidance, compulsions and various types of safety seeking behaviours. As such, it is important that the therapist elicits the roles these behavioural features play in the maintenance of the patient’s problems.

Key features: To help the patient gain insight into the effect of his/her behaviours with respect to the problems. This can be done through the use of questioning, diaries and monitoring procedures.. Two features need to be considered: 
(i) eliciting behaviours that are associated with distressing emotions (including, use of safety seeking behaviours); 
(ii) the skilfulness and breadth of the methods used (i.e. Socratic questioning; appropriate monitoring, imagery, role-plays, etc.). 
NB: This item is concerned with the general work done with eliciting behaviours. If any specific cognitive or behavioural change methods are used, they should be scored under item 11 (Application of change methods). It is important to examine the role that behaviours have in triggering and maintaining the patient’s disorder. Behaviours often reinforce both negative thoughts and feelings. For example, the typical avoidance observed in social phobia prevents the person overcoming his/her fear, and obtaining the skills necessary to engage in social interactions. Some activities can be termed “safety seeking behaviours” as patients employ them as a means of reducing their levels of distress (e.g. self monitoring procedures, holding on tightly to objects). However, safety behaviours can often serve to unwittingly maintain a person’s problems, ensuring that the dysfunctional cycles are preserved. On occasions the patient might react to difficulties by overcompensating in some manner (e.g. becoming aggressive when feeling vulnerable); such behavioural patterns clearly ought to be elicited and examined in relation to the relevant emotions associated with them. The following table (Table 8.1) outlines some of the common forms of safety seeking behaviours associated with the different disorders. It is relevant to note that safety behaviours are often distinguished from avoidance and withdrawal strategies. The latter are escape strategies (e.g. avoidance of situations/objects/people), while the former are active (ie. non-avoidant) behaviours that either (i) reduce a perceived risk, or (ii) are used by the person to cope in situations where negative feelings are being experienced. 


CHECKLIST: QUESTIONS FOR RATERS TO ASK THEMSELVES:
1. Did the therapist examine adequately the role that behavioural features played in the triggering and maintenance of the patient’s problems? 
2. Did the therapist help the patient discover the impact of his/her behaviours in terms of relevant emotional features? 
3. Did you hear any of the following: 
- When you felt fearful, did you do anything that reduced your level of fear? 
- If I had a camera and filmed you when you are feeling low, what would I see? 
- Some people develop habits or rituals, have you noticed any patterns to your behaviour? 
- When you check your heart rate, how do you feel? 

Item 9 - Guided Discovery 
Introduction
Guided discovery is a form of presentation and questioning which assists the patient to gain new perspectives for himself/herself without the use of debate or lecturing. It is used throughout the sessions in order to help promote the patient to gain understanding. It is based on the principles of Socratic dialogue, whereby a questioning style is used to promote discovery, to explore concepts, synthesise ideas and develop hypotheses regarding the patient’s problems and experiences. The key features of ’Guided Discovery’ is outlined in the CTS-R Rating Scale as follows: Key features: The patient should be helped to develop hypotheses regarding his/her current situation and to generate potential solutions for him/herself. The patient is helped to develop a range of perspectives regarding his/her experience. Effective guided discovery will create doubt where previously there was certainty, thus providing the opportunity for re-evaluation and new learning to occur. Two elements need to be considered: 
(i) the style of the therapist - this should be open and inquisitive; 
(ii) the effective use of questioning techniques (e.g. Socratic questions) should encourage the patient to discover useful information that can be used to help him/her to gain a better level of understanding.

It has been observed that patients are more likely to adopt new perspectives, if they perceive they have been able to come to such views and conclusions for themselves. Hence, rather than adopting a debating stance, the therapist should use a questioning style to engage the patient in a problem solving process. Skilfully phrased questions, which are presented in a clear manner, can help to highlight either links or discrepancies in the patient's thinking. In order to accommodate the new information or learning, new insight is often achieved. Padesky (1993) emphasises that the aim of questioning is not to 'change minds' through logic, but to engage the patient in a Socratic dialogue. Within this dialogue the patient can arrive at new perspectives and solutions for themselves. The therapist's questioning technique should reveal a constant flow of inquiry from concrete and specific ("Does your mood drop every time you argue with your mother?") to abstract ("Do you always feel this way when someone is shouting at you?") and back again ("What thoughts were going through your head when it was your mother shouting?"). Good questions are those asked in the spirit of inquiry, while bad ones are those which lead the patient to a predetermined conclusion. The techniques may also permit the patient to make both lateral and vertical linkages. The lateral links are those day to day features of the patient's life which produce and maintain his/her difficulties (i.e. the NATs, dysfunctional behaviours, moods and physical sensations). The vertical links are the historical patterns and cycles, which manifestly relate to the patient's current problems (i.e. childhood issues, parenting, relationship difficulties, work issues, etc.). The questions posed should not be way-beyond the patient's current level of understanding, as this is unlikely to promote effective change. Rather they should be phrased within, or just outside, the patient's current understanding in order that he/she can make realistic attempts to answer them. The product of attempting to deal with such intelligently phrased question is likely to be new discoveries. The therapists should appear both inquisitive and sensitive without coming across as patronising. 

CHECKLIST: QUESTIONS FOR RATERS TO ASK THEMSELVES:
1. Has the therapist used appropriate questions? 
2. Does the manner in which the questions are asked facilitate the patient's understanding? 
3. Did the questions lead to or promote change? 
4. Did you hear any of the following: 
- I wonder whether there are any other times in your life when you felt the same way? 
- You have this dreadful image when you're with both John and Paul, but you never have it with Peter. Can you think of a reason for this? 
- If you were not depressed, how might you think differently about this situation? 
- How does this relate to what you told me earlier - that you never get anything right? 
- What is the common link between X and Y? 

Item 10 - Conceptual Integration 
Introduction
Conceptualisation concerns the provision of an appropriate knowledge base that promotes understanding and facilitates therapeutic change. It encompasses both the cognitive therapy rationale and the cognitive formulation. Through the conceptualisation the patient will gain an understanding of the cognitive rationale of his/her disorder, its underlying and maintaining features, and relevant triggers. Importantly, the patient should also gain an understanding of the relative efficacy of the coping strategies currently being used in order to deal with the problem. The conceptualisation process involves initially socialising the patient to the therapeutic rationale (i.e. establishing the links between "thoughts ? feelings ? behaviours"). Its specific format will vary with respect to the different disorders. 

After the initial assessment phase, the process involves the development of an appropriate understanding of the problem. This is termed formulation, and is a personalised account of the disorder in terms of both its genesis and maintaining features. The formulation involves establishing the lateral (i.e. situational and maintaining features) and vertical (i.e. historical) linkages underpinning the disorder. Following the formulation, the patient must acquire the knowledge of what needs to be changed and the most appropriate strategies for change (i.e. change mechanisms). When working effectively, both the therapist and patient will have a shared theoretical understanding of the aims, model and current status of the therapy with respect to the therapeutic goals. 

The key features of 'conceptualisation' is outlined in the CTS-R Rating Scale as follows:
Key features: The patient should be helped to gain an appreciation of the history, triggers and maintaining features of his/her problem in order to bring about change in the present and future. The therapist should help the patient to gain an understanding of how his/her perceptions and interpretations, beliefs, attitudes and rules relate to his/her problem. A good conceptualisation will examine previous cognitions and coping strategies as well as current ones. This theory-based understanding should be well integrated and used to guide the therapy forward. Two features need to be considered: 
(i) the presence/absence of an appropriate conceptualisation which is in line with goals of therapy; 
(ii) the manner in which the conceptualisation is used (e.g. used as the platform for interventions, homework etc.). 
NB: This item is to do with therapeutic integration (using theory to link present, past and future). If the therapist deals specifically with cognitions and emotions, this should be scored under Items 6 (Facilitation of Emotional Expression) and 7 (Eliciting Key of Cognitions). Conceptualising is one of the key processes of therapy through which change takes place. It provides the theoretical overview of the work. Its absence can lead to disjointed therapy, which might prevent major insight being gained by the patient. When it is not appropriately integrated within therapy, the work may lose its focus and only consist of a set of unrelated techniques. In order for effective therapy to occur the conceptualisation must be appropriate. To arrive at an appropriate cognitive rationale a thorough assessment needs to take place, in which both therapist and patient collect information to increase their understanding of the problem. Through this data-gathering process the patient learns to monitor the important features of his/her disorder (NATs, feelings, behaviours, safety behaviours, cognitive biases, etc.), and thereby gain further insight. To instigate this process effectively, the therapist must have a good theoretical understanding of generic cognitive therapy and the specifics of the patient’s disorder (i.e. the cognitive models of depression, panic, OCD, PTSD, etc.). 

During this period, patients learn to break down situations using the rationale. In essence, they begin to become their own therapist. This process is often facilitated greatly through the use of suitable written material. Typically the therapist will illustrate relationships via diagrams or through the use of examples, stories and/or metaphors. If not performed adequately, the patient can feel misunderstood and alienated. He/she may become less active both in an out of sessions. A good collaborative relationship is usually essential in developing a comprehensive formulation. The therapist must also be sensitive, particularly when working at the level of core beliefs. It is important to remember, however, that these features should be rated under the relevant items (e.g. Collaboration & 
Interpersonal Effectiveness respectively). One of the main purposes of establishing the CT rationale is to socialise the patient to the model and generate evidence towards the formulation. The appropriately constructed formulation should be able to explain most of the features of the patient's disorders (historical and present, including: fears, vulnerabilities, avoidance, maintenance and compensation strategies, effective and dysfunctional coping strategies, etc.). The ultimate aim of the formulation is to arrive at an agreed set of key core beliefs which, based on empirical evidence, make a major contribution to the patient's understanding of his/her current difficulties. Thus the formulation provides the foundation for change. This shared 'frame of reference' then leads on to the choice of treatment techniques that help inform potential change mechanisms. 

A good conceptualisation will provide an awareness of effective and dysfunctional cycles of thoughts <-> emotions <-> behaviour and thereby suggest potential mechanisms of change. It is important to note that the patient’s self-conceptualisation will not be entirely negative and dysfunctional. Therefore it is vital, when helping to define him/herself, that the therapist highlights the patient’s strengths too. This more balanced conceptualisation, may also help clarify areas that could be used effectively in promoting change. 

CHECKLIST: QUESTIONS FOR RATERS TO ASK THEMSELVES:
1. Has the therapist socialised the patient to the CT rationale? 
2. Does the therapist demonstrate a good understanding of generic CT? 
3. Does the therapist demonstrate a good understanding of the CT rationale for the specific disorder? 
4. Does the patient have an adequate CT understanding of the problem? 
5. If you asked the patient about his her problems, would he/she be able to produce a working conceptualisation that was broadly consistent with a CT perspective? 
6. Has the conceptualisation been truly integrated (i.e. has it been used to guide the therapy)? 
7. Did you hear any of the following: 
- Let's see how the various things we have talked about hold together. 
- What we have done so far is look at the way your thoughts affect the way you feel and what you do. It would be useful for us today to look at some general rules and attitudes that are contained in these thoughts. The reason for doing this is for us to try to understand where they come from. Is this OK with you? 
- Do you remember anybody saying this to you: "You are no good"? 
- Let's look at times in your life when you have been depressed before. 
- Are there times in your life when you have felt good about yourself? 
- Does this way of looking at your depression make sense to you? 

Item 11 - Application of Change Methods 
Introduction
Change methodologies are cognitive and behavioural strategies employed by the therapist which are consistent with the cognitive rationale and/or formulation and designed to promote therapeutic change. The potency of the techniques will depend upon whether they are applied at the appropriate stage in therapy, and the degree to which they are implemented skilfully. It is important to note that during some sessions it may not be appropriate to use a wide range of methods; a rater should take this into account when scoring this item. The key features of 'Application of change methods' is outlined in the CTS-R Rating Scale as follows:
Key features: Therapist skilfully uses, and helps the patient to use, appropriate cognitive and behavioural techniques in line with the formulation. The therapist helps the patient devise appropriate cognitive methods to evaluate the key cognitions associated with distressing emotions, leading to major new perspectives and shifts in emotions. The therapist also helps the patient to apply behavioural techniques in line with the formulation. The therapist helps the patient to identify potential difficulties and think through the cognitive rationales for performing the tasks. The methods provide useful ways for the patient to testout cognitions practically and gain experience in dealing with high levels of emotion. The methods also allow the therapist to obtain feedback regarding the patient’s level of understanding of prospective practical assignments (i.e. by the patient performing the task in-session). Two features need to be considered: 
(i) the appropriateness and range of both cognitive methods (e.g. cognitive change diaries, continua, distancing, responsibility charts, evaluating alternatives, examining pros and cons, determining meanings, imagery restructuring, etc.) and behavioural methods (e.g. behavioural diaries, behavioural tests, role play, graded task assignments, response prevention, reinforcement of patient’s work, 
modelling, applied relaxation, controlled breathing, etc.); 
(ii) the skill in the application of the methods – however, skills such as feedback, interpersonal effectiveness, etc. should be rated separately under their appropriate items; 
(iii) the suitability of the methods for the needs of the patient (i.e. neither too difficult nor complex). 
NB: This item is not concerned with accessing or identifying thoughts, rather with their re-evaluation. In deciding the appropriateness of a method it is important to determine whether the technique is a coherent strategy for change, following logically from the patient's formulation. Clinical judgement is required in assessing the degree of skill with which a particular methodology is applied. This feature goes beyond mere adherence (i.e. the preciseness with which a technique is applied). Indeed, the rater should be concerned with the manner of application, i.e. the therapist must be articulate, comprehensible, sensitive and systematic when discussing and implementing the technique. The therapist should also be creative and resourceful in his/her selection of methods. He/she should be 
able to draw upon a wide range of suitable cognitive and behavioural methodologies. It is important to remember that the same technique can have a different function depending on the stage of therapy. For example, a diary can act as an assessment tool early on in therapy, but later may serve as an effective way of promoting the re-evaluation of thought processes. The timing of the intervention is vital and must be suited to the needs of the patient. For example, if a therapist challenges basic assumptions or core beliefs too early in therapy, before he/she has a clear understanding of the patient's view of the world, the patient could feel misunderstood and alienated. Only after sufficient socialisation, should the therapist get the patient to start to reassess that level of cognition. The evaluation of automatic thoughts starts earlier, first as part of the socialisation into the 
cognitive model and then as a change method to improve mood and to improve on coping behaviour. 

As with the application of cognitive techniques, the therapist must display skill in applying behavioural methodologies. The rationale for employing the tasks should be carefully explored, and clear learning goals established. It is important to remember that behavioural tasks play a key role with respect to the reinforcement of new learning. For example, by engaging a patient in a role-play, one can assess whether the theoretical information has been truly learned and integrated into his/her behavioural repertoire. The role-play will also allow the person to practice new skills. Behavioural tasks are also useful methodologies to employ prior to asking the patient to use the activity in a homework task. For example, it is useful to get the patient to complete monitoring sheets within the session in order to ensure the task is understood correctly. In this way the behavioural methodologies are important feedback and reinforcement activities. In addition, the therapist needs to elicit and develop practical plans with the patient in order that effective change takes place (e.g. the where, what, when, and how of a desensitisation programme). Indeed, part of the process of producing effective behavioural change is the development of plans that help to test out hypotheses and break unhelpful patterns of behaviour. For example, when setting a behavioural task, the therapist should get the patient to: 
- think through the relevance of the assignment 
- be confident in his/her ability to perform it, and be sufficiently motivated 
- check through anticipated level of arousal 
- plan what needs to be done carefully, and be cognisant of potential obstacles 
- practice the behaviour 
- be able to relate either success or failure to a change in perspective. 
In planning the task, relevant questions should be asked of the person’s concepts, cognitions, affective and physiological states, and behavioural repertoire. See Figure 11.1 below. 

It is important to note that sometimes it is inappropriate to use many methodologies within a particular session. The therapist should not be penalised in such cases, when done for appropriate reasons. 
CHECKLIST: QUESTIONS FOR RATERS TO ASK THEMSELVES:
1. Has the therapist ensured that the patient understands the rationale underpinning the method? 
2. Was the method conducted skilfully? 
3. Were the learning goals achieved? 
4. Were too many/few techniques used in the session? 
5. Were the techniques suitable and appropriate for the patient (i.e. neither too complicated nor too demanding)? 
6. Was the technique consistent with the formulation? 
7. Were the techniques administered with skill? 
8. Prior to using the techniques were the learning goals clearly established? 
9. Where necessary, was a competent explanation of the rationale of the technique given? 
10. Were there valuable opportunities missed when appropriate techniques could have been administered? 
11. Did you hear any of the following: 
- What are the benefits of thinking in this way . . . and are there any problems? 
- How else could you have seen this situation? Are there alternative views? 
- What would you say to your best friend? 
- Have you ever had the same experience in the past and reacted differently? 
- Would other people have the same opinion of you? 
- What are the disadvantages of thinking that way? What are the advantages? 
- Let's see whether there are events/situations/experiences that disconfirm this belief about yourself? 
- Can we test this assumption in the next week? What might you try and do differently to see whether your predictions are right 
- See questions outlined in Figure 11.1 

Item 12 - Homework Setting 
Introduction
Progress is more likely to occur when patients are able to apply the concepts learned in the therapy sessions to their lives outside; homework assignments are the bridges between therapy and the real world. The current item rates the therapist's competence in setting relevant homework tasks. The tasks should be 'custom-tailored' to the needs of the patient. They should ideally test hypotheses, incorporate new perspectives, and may encourage the patient to experiment with new behaviours outside of the session. The therapist should always explain the rationale for the prospective assignments, and elicit reactions to the homework. The homework rationale should follow on logically from the contents of the session and be consistent with the formulation. Key features: This aspect concerns the setting of an appropriate homework task, one with clear and Precise goals. The aims should be to negotiate an appropriate task for the stage of therapy in line with the conceptualisation; to ensure the patient understands the rationale for undertaking the task; to test out ideas, try new experiences, predict and deal with potential obstacles, and experiment with new ways of responding. This item ensures that the content of the therapy session is both relevant to, and integrated with, the patient’s environment. There are three aspects to this item: 
(i) presence/absence of a homework task in which clear and precise goals have been set; 
(ii) the task should be derived from material discussed in the session, such that there is a clear understanding of what will be learnt from performing the task; 
(iii) the homework task should be set jointly, and sufficient time should be allowed for it to be explained clearly (i.e. explain, discuss relevance, predict obstacles, etc.). 
NB: Review of homework from the previous session should be rated in Item 1 (Agenda Setting).Homework helps to transfer within-session learning to real-life settings. In other words, this item bridges the gap between in-session work and the patient’s activity out of the therapy session. To facilitate the transfer, the homework material is usually based upon material discussed in the session. 
 
Homework also provides a structure for helping patients gather data and test hypotheses. It also encourages autonomy rather than reliance on the therapist, and therefore plays an important role in relapse prevention. To help empower the patient, and encourage compliance, the assignments should be negotiated. It also is important to explore possible difficulties, and how these might be overcome. To mitigate against potential problems. It is often useful for the therapist to suggest that the patient visualise carrying out the assignment to identify future problems. In addition, it is desirable to get patient's feedback regarding a specific assignment ("Does it sound useful?" "Does it seem manageable?" "Is the assignment clear?" "What will be learned from the accomplishment/non-accomplishment of the task?"). These questions will help to determine whether the patient is both clear about the task, and understands the cognitive rationale underpinning it. It is vital that the patient is aware of the cognitive aspects of the assignment and how the results will impact on his/her interpretations. Indeed, one of the important features of homework tasks is that they bring about cognitive shift, and so they must be seen as more than just isolated behavioural assignments. Because the setting of homework tends to occur towards the end of the session, there is sometimes a tendency to rush the process. This tendency should be avoided, as it can lead to ill-prepared and unclear tasks being set. Hence it is good practice to leave sufficient time to set the homework appropriately.
 
CHECKLIST: QUESTIONS FOR RATERS TO ASK THEMSELVES:
1. Did the therapist adequately explain the rationale underpinning the assignment? 
2. Did the therapist check that the patient was confident about conducting the task correctly? 
3. Did the patient see the relevance of the assignment? 
4. Was the assignment adequately planned within the session? 
5. Were the obstacles to conducting the plan discussed? 
6. Were the learning goals established sufficiently?

Speaker 1: Yep.  

Speaker 0: And you started off, you know, a second ago just sort of telling me a bit, but would you mind just sort of giving me an idea of how your mood's been over the last week?  Yeah, well, obviously since the fire, which was on the Thursday, I've sort of I'm over the trauma of it, you know, for sort of three or four days I kept bursting into tears, which I think was the shock.  

Speaker 1: But I acknowledge that I really, the best of me really did come out when it happened.  But the most remarkable thing for me, whether it will change, I don't know, is I haven't seen you for a fortnight.  

Speaker 0: And to my knowledge...  

Speaker 1: In that whole fortnight, I've had two panic attacks.  Rather than five a week, I've had like one a week.  And I've done my utmost to ignore them.  There's been a couple of occasions where I've felt I'm going to go backwards.  One time I worked really hard on ignoring it and didn't go backwards.  The other time I couldn't.  I had to hold on to something, you know.  So it will be interesting to see if I can... persevere with trying to ignore that, whether it actually is something physical or psychological.  Because I'm not a hundred percent convinced either way yet where that's concerned.  But actually I feel really quite proud of myself because of how I dealt with this blinking fire.  I know I saved.  I didn't know until the firemen arrived that I've got great big thick double glazing everywhere, which is lovely because the place is really warm.  But I didn't know that there's a button you can press in the hinge which will open the window right up.  They showed me that when they came.  So I could only get the window open that far.  Because everything was on fire round the window, I'm shoving everything out.  And the firemen had said, because the flames were lapping up the side of the TV.  And you don't think, well, I've got house insurance.  You just react, don't you?  And I literally was just snatching at everything, whacking it out the window.  And they said, you know, literally another minute, minute and a half, and we would have lost the lounge, everything in the lounge, you know, because it burned the carpet, the sofa.  

Speaker 0: Because as I pulled the first curtain...  

Speaker 1: not knowing it had burnt across the middle, little bits of it dropped up, flicked behind me and set the sofa fleeces on fire.  I'm just actually really quite proud of the way that I dealt with it.  I'm a bit ashamed of how much I was screaming afterwards.  I certainly got to know my neighbours because I only lived there a few weeks.  

Speaker 0: They all know who I am now.  The place obviously looks very ugly.  You're ashamed of screaming after that?  

Speaker 1: I am, actually, a little bit, because I was screaming, how can you be so effing stupid?  I want to show you a picture of, this is after the clean-up.  

Speaker 0: I'm still talking to you, though.  So when you say you're ashamed of screaming...  

Speaker 1: That's after the clean-up, that's just next to where I sit.  

Speaker 0: Quite you.  So when you say you're ashamed of... So you were ashamed that you actually screamed, or you were ashamed...  

Speaker 1: I was ashamed, A, that I could be so stupid to leave a candle on a windowsill with curtains and walk out of the room.  I've done it many... I love candles.  I've done it many times before.  I had the back door open because I had the tumble dryer going, which I presume caused a draft and either the foil or the curtains caught the candle.  So I'm a little bit ashamed that I was so stupid for something like that to happen.  I have never in my life seen anything move so fast.  And I guess survival just kicks in, doesn't it?  Which is how I responded.  But yeah, I was really... I mean, I was shocked, I guess.  I was screaming like a dervish outside.  

Speaker 0: So you were actually ashamed that you screamed?  

Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I was screaming at myself.  I was so angry with myself.  

Speaker 0: So what was the worst bit about screaming for you?  

Speaker 1: The audience I had looking back.  Not at the time, I didn't give a monkey's at the time, but looking back on it, they'd probably think there's a loony living in that corner bungalow, you know?  

Speaker 0: Okay, and are you spending much time thinking about this?  I keep thinking about the fact that I've...  

Speaker 1: if you like, laid myself bare to all the neighbours, you know.  

Speaker 0: So thinking about today and thinking about how we're going to use our time best, what do you think would be most useful for you to talk about?  Could that be one of the, you know, would you want to talk about that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, because  

Speaker 1: what I would like to do is be able to  

Speaker 0: accept  

Speaker 1: that I had an extremely lucky escape, I was insured, and I'd like to actually move on and forget it, and just, you know, the repair work and the reclamation work and whatever they do  

Speaker 0: has all begun.  Because one of the things, the reason I ask that is one of the things that I was going to, you know, try, well not, suggest about putting on the agenda today is, you know, part of CBT is about, you know, trying to sort of look at our behaviour and, you know, whether things we do sort of affect how we feel.  And the other big idea which we've talked a lot about is our thoughts, yeah, and the idea that you can think about things in more than one way.  And depending on how you think about it will depend on how you feel and how you behave.  And I was just wondering whether, you know, your experience of feeling quite ashamed and being quite critical of yourself might be a good opportunity for us to have a look at a thought diary, which I think we've talked about in the past, haven't we?  

Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not something that I've kept, but yeah, sure.  We did have a go at one, didn't we, once?  No, the only thing I've ever done is... the panic attacks and just keeping a diary of my activities.  So no, that's the only things I've done.  

Speaker 0: So do you think, would it be okay if we sort of looked at your experience of that and your thoughts of yourself around that in the context of looking at a thought diary?  

Speaker 1: Absolutely.  I mean, I do feel that there has been quite a colossal change in me within this last week.  Not just because of that, but because something else happened the day before.  

Speaker 0: I'd seen a friend, he'd find me via my daughter because her first name's Portia, which of course is unusual on Facebook.  And I'd not seen him in nearly eighteen years.  And he's gay.  

Speaker 1: And the last time I saw him, he'd just, as they call it, come out of the closet.  I used to work on the buses with him.  And he came over on the day that I rang you, look, because I'd been to hospital for a few hours and come home.  And I was so excited about seeing him.  And seeing the change in him in eighteen years, and that he's become a very effeminate gay, and a very obviously gay man, and he told me a lot about his lifestyle, and he's into hard drugs, and I just thought... I can remember someone saying to me years ago, you can never go back in life.  And that really proved it for me, because part of me really wanted the close friendship that we'd had years ago, but another part of me acknowledges, actually no, I've moved on with my life.  He's gone into some weird little, I don't know, sect that I'd rather have nothing to do with.  And it's all, I can't put into  

Speaker 0: words what it has  

Speaker 1: done for me, but it's just that one person and the fact that they have changed so much has made me accept  

Speaker 0: perhaps that there are certain things that maybe  

Speaker 1: I can let go of and maybe  

Speaker 0: I can accept look just  

Speaker 1: forget that and just move on.  certainly that's what I'm doing with the panic attacks.  

Speaker 0: to some degree I'm thinking look you know what that is.  just try and concentrate on something you know whatever you know.  I can feel that and I don't know whether this is the CBT doing this for me but there's definitely been a change within me.  So, I guess, just so I can try and understand more what you're talking about, are you saying that what you're learning more or recognising more is things that can change, things can move on?  

Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.  And that I can move on and that I don't need to sit and ponder over stuff that isn't... You know, even though I've been aware that it's self-destructive, I'm hoping that perhaps I've now adopted an ability... to accept, well, that is just destructive, therefore don't give it headspace.  I mean, it's very easy to pay that lip service, but to actually do it is another thing.  

Speaker 0: So if we think about that in terms of the cognitive model that we've been sort of discussing here, how do you think that sort of fits within that model?  

Speaker 1: Well, it's changed my thought patterns, I guess.  It's changed the way that... If I'd seen this, my kid's name is this gay lad, if I'd seen him two years ago under the same circumstances, you know, and think, forget the fire, well, that was the next day anyway, but.  you know, if I'd seen him a couple of years ago before I started seeing you, I think I probably would have continued, because I've already decided I don't particularly want a friendship with him now, which might sound a bit harsh, but that's the way I feel.  But a couple of years ago, or even a year ago, six months ago, I probably would have pursued that friendship for a time and perhaps become involved in another destructive area of my life.  

Speaker 0: I don't know.  I don't know.  Right.  So you're saying that you kind of see that you have choices.  You can do things that will make you feel worse.  

Speaker 1: Yes.  

Speaker 0: Or you can try and do things that will make you feel better.  

Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  Yes, that just seems to be coming a bit clearer to me and a bit easier to make the decision.  

Speaker 0: And are you also saying that, you know, what you're recognising, you know, if I try and sort of use the language of the model, as it were... There are vicious circles.  If you sort of think about these awful things or terrible things, then you're going to feel quite awful.  The more awful you feel, the more likely you are to do awful things.  Does that feel like it?  Yes, it's definitely kicking in.  Okay, so in terms of today then, talk a bit about where you're left after the fire and see whether we can sort of have a look at the thought diary in relation to that.  I can sort of introduce that to you.  And is there anything else that you want to talk about?  I don't know whether it's something that I can cover with you.  

Speaker 1: I mean, the bottom line is, as you know, last week I was unwell and I do have just a solid bit of pneumonia down in this lung.  I have got to give up smoking.  more than anything else I have got to give up, especially the weed.  I don't know if that's something that can be dealt with in CBT.  I mean, I'm partway there in that I know I've got to do it.  I don't I don't know I can't seem to make that first step this time.  that I did last time you know as in crushing the last few fags and but I desperately want to.  

Speaker 0: that actually is what I want more than anything is to be able to give up smoking.  right okay I mean I guess in terms of you know what we can do here.  you know ideally what we're trying to treat is your depression here.  yeah you know if we then if we sort of try and look at giving up smoking, then it doesn't give us the opportunity to look at treating the depression.  Fair enough, yeah.  So that's sort of one choice.  And, you know, I guess the other thing is, you know, are there other sort of places out there that could help you give up the smoking?  

Speaker 1: I've already inquired as much as I can and got all the little Nicorette things.  Yeah.  But that's basically all that's out there for you.  You can sit and chat with a very sweet nurse, you know, for ten minutes.  who will...  

Speaker 0: Have you been and seen them?  

Speaker 1: Yes, yes, I did that either at the beginning of the year or last year, I can't remember which.  Yes, I've actually done it twice.  I asked you didn't I last time if you knew of anything that was happening out there regarding smoking.  

Speaker 0: All I know is that surgeries are the best place usually for it.  From my understanding I thought they did use a bit of CBT really.  

Speaker 1: Some of the practitioners in helping people give up smoking.  

Speaker 0: It doesn't work like that at our surgery.  

Speaker 1: You referred to a nurse who was apparently the stop smoking nurse.  

Speaker 0: My understanding is some of those nurses use a bit of CBT to help people.  Oh, right.  So I don't know whether it would be worth having another look at that.  I can always re-pursue it, yeah.  But I guess in terms of our time here, it's about what's going to be most useful in terms of helping you treat your depression, really, and the anxiety that you suffer.  

Speaker 1: Yeah.  I would honestly say, I mean, if somebody said to me, are you a depressed person?  Now, I would say sometimes.  

Speaker 0: Yeah.  

Speaker 1: Whereas before, I was miserable all of the time.  

Speaker 0: Okay.  So things definitely feel like they're starting to shift.  You're starting to think about things in a bit of a different way.  You're starting to recognise that you're sort of making different choices that seem to be sort of having a more positive outcome for you.  Okay.  So you were saying about the panic and that was one of the things that you were going to monitor for your homework.  Yes, yes.  

Speaker 1: Much less.  Absolutely.  A hell of a lot less.  Right.  Yeah.  And apart from going backwards a couple of times, I've only noticed it twice.  And again, both times it's been in the evening and it's just come from nowhere.  Panic, panic, panic, panic, panic.  Heart thumping.  And then I haven't actually been aware of the moment that it stopped as such.  But I've been able to.  concentrate on something else acknowledge that that's just what it is and then it's then I've realised or I haven't even realised.  

Speaker 0: then I've just moved on with the rest of the evening if you like.  

Speaker 1: it's not hung around for as long as it was hanging around either.  

Speaker 0: so if we look at the where's the?  alright so where are you catching it?  then are you catching it?  so we said the trigger.  so something happens and you notice usually a physical symptom first don't you?  and then there's the interpretation of that physical.  you think oh I'm going to panic here and that increases the anxiety.  so where would you say you're catching it then?  

Speaker 1: at the moment I haven't.  it hasn't gone so far as my stomach right.  Just the adrenaline and the heart pumping is all I've experienced.  So above here you get heart pumping, that's the first thing you notice?  Yes, well the adrenaline and then the heart pumping, they all almost coincide.  

Speaker 0: And when you say the adrenaline, what do you notice?  when the adrenaline... What do you mean, what do I notice?  Well you say you notice the adrenaline first.  Yes, it just... And how do you notice adrenaline, what do you experience?  

Speaker 1: Just waves of adrenaline and panic going over me.  

Speaker 0: So you feel... So what you...  

Speaker 1: Something's wrong, something's wrong, that sort of...  

Speaker 0: Right, so heart pumping and then you get the thought, something's wrong.  

Speaker 1: Yeah, what is it?  that's bothering, what's the problem, sort of, panic.  

Speaker 0: Okay, and that's what you mean by the waves of adrenaline, is it?  

Speaker 1: No, the waves of adrenaline, it is almost a physical thing, it is literally a wave, literally, of adrenaline.  So if you had to describe to me exactly what that felt like in your body, how does that feel?  How does it feel?  To describe it in a physical sense, as if somebody was flushing a liquid right up through me.  

Speaker 0: So you feel a whoosh in your body?  Yes.  Okay.  So that's the first thing that you notice, and when you get that...  

Speaker 1: Then I notice my heart's doing that.  

Speaker 0: Yep.  And you're catching it at that point, are you?  Yes.  And what are you doing or saying?  

Speaker 1: I'm saying to myself, oh, that's not again.  Out of the two times, I can definitely remember one time doing my dentist, not to take the deep breath.  

Speaker 0: Yeah.  

Speaker 1: and I don't remember it actually wearing off but it must have done.  and the other one which was only two or three nights ago and it went on for a lot longer.  but I don't know if you've ever suffered a plant you can't.  it's very difficult to stop taking that.  you know and I don't know if that's like a safety mechanism or but that seems to be enough, or it's seemed to have been enough.  

Speaker 0: And what is it that you're saying to yourself, sorry?  

Speaker 1: This is just that thing.  That thing, yeah.  

Speaker 0: And do you have to keep saying that to yourself, or do you... Actually, then I start saying, it'll go, it'll go, it'll go.  

Speaker 1: That's what I start saying to myself, it'll go, it'll go.  And it does.  

Speaker 0: And do you notice that you're doing anything else to try and make it go?  No, I'm not doing anything else.  Nothing at all?  Nothing.  So you held on once and the other time... Oh, that's a different thing.  Because I'm not convinced that that's a panic attack.  And I wish that the neurosurgeon had never suggested that.  Right.  Because I don't think that is.  Because why, when I'm standing... um it's a slightly different.  

Speaker 1: it's a different feeling because i don't get the heart pumping and the adrenaline with that i just think i'm gonna fall back.  yes yeah okay i just think i'm gonna fall back.  

Speaker 0: so when you're if we focus on the other stuff then yeah when you're getting the whoosh and the heart pumping and you say this this is just that thing it'll go it'll go it'll go.  do you do anything to try and make it go at all To keep yourself safe?  

Speaker 1: No, no.  I might sort of turn around and pick up the paper, you know, the newspaper.  

Speaker 0: Or I might deliberately try to concentrate on whatever's going on on the television.  Right, so you distract yourself from your thoughts.  

Speaker 1: Yes, but that's not necessarily a conscious thing.  

Speaker 0: I think that's a subconscious thing probably that I've picked up over the last couple of weeks.  Okay.  

Speaker 1: That maybe that's the best way to deal.  

Speaker 0: Certainly that's how I am dealing with it.  So you were saying that, when you were saying you were fifty-fifty about the panic, were you talking specifically about this sort of holding on thing?  Because you said you're not quite sure.  So, you know, in terms of, you know, where are you left now in terms of your understanding of sort of the panic attacks then?  What sense do you make of them now?  

Speaker 1: The sense I make of them now is quite possibly I'll always have them.  But I know now that they're not going to make my heart explode.  They're not going to make me more ill.  I'm not going to have a total breakdown.  I mean, I don't like it, but it's not as much of a worry as it was not by any means.  

Speaker 0: And would you say that you're actually getting panic attacks now if you're stopping it at that top point?  

Speaker 1: Well, certainly not as often.  Because I've only noticed a couple.  But on the other hand, I mean, to be fair, with all that's happened in the last week, it's possible I've had another one or two and haven't.  

Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.  But in terms of the panic, then, you know, they're not nice.  They don't feel great.  No.  But they're not going to kill you.  No.  They're not going to send you crazy.  Mm-hmm.  

Speaker 1: And actually, by talking to yourself and saying, you know, this is just a panic attack, I'm going to be all right.  Mm-hmm.  has left you feeling much more in control?  Yeah, I can deal with it.  If I had to put up with it for the rest of my life, I could deal with it a lot easier than I could have a month ago.  

Speaker 0: Okay.  So is there anything else that you think we need to be doing about the panic at this point, or are you happy to just keep monitoring this?  

Speaker 1: Yeah, no, I'll just keep monitoring it.  I've... got a little bit better at.  perhaps because I've had to with all the insurance companies that are involved with this fire.  I've had to make calls because the phone is my thing.  I don't like I've had to make calls.  I suppose it's much easier when you haven't got a choice isn't it?  and that hasn't been a major problem for me really.  I mean, I still, if I can, will put off making a phone call for, you know, or I'll do it this afternoon rather than this morning.  I'll do it, you know, and of course there is the connection of smoking weed.  

Speaker 0: If I've had a smoke, I think, well, I'll wait until I'm straight before I ring them.  Okay.  And this is sort of the more sort of social kind of anxiety stuff that kind of sits with you, isn't it?  The worry about, you know, what people are going to think about you and how you're going to present to other people.  Yeah.  That I'm going to make a fool of myself, I think, possibly.  Because I remember you talking last week about worrying that your breakdown, you won't be able to get your point across and people will think...  

Speaker 1: That I was just a neurotic woman, yeah.  

Speaker 0: And that you're weak and feeds into some of the other sort of rules and ideas that you've got, yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  And I guess these are the sort of issues that we're likely to be talking about a bit more over the next few weeks because we've been trying to work quite behaviourally, haven't we, for the last five sessions.  So you've been trying to get a bit more active.  We've been working on the panic.  And I guess the next thing it sounds like, which we started talking about a bit last week, is more the thoughts and the ideas you have about you and that perhaps we'll be shifting on to next.  Does that sound interesting?  

Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  

Speaker 0: Okay.  Okay.  So are there any more questions in relation to that before we move on?  Are you happy with that?  Yeah.  Okay.  So we said that we were going to have a look at what happened with the fire.  Mm-hmm.  and the thoughts that you've sort of been left with, that you feel quite ashamed about, the way you responded to that.  Yeah?  Can you, do you mind sort of just telling me a bit more about that?  What actually happened?  Well, just what you're thinking, really, you know, and... Um... with your mum and unfortunately my father being rather dramatic most members of the family and everybody came round and cleaned everything up.  once the firemen would let us back in but a neighbour had heard the alarm which I was trying to shut up with the broom not having noticed the curtains on fire And she had come into the house and kept on filling up the washing up bowl with water because what I didn't realise was that everything I'd managed to get out of the window was on fire outside the window.  So she kept coming and getting bowls of water and chucking it over it.  

Speaker 1: And I just kept on screaming, you fucking idiot, you fucking idiot.  

Speaker 0: And then I rang my mother and... who immediately panicked, and this neighbour took my phone from me and said, let me speak to your mum, and said, it's all right, the fire's out, the brigade are on their way.  And then I just found myself apologising to the fireman, and then just started shouting at myself what an idiot I was.  And then they made me sit down and put an oxygen thingy on me.  

Speaker 1: I didn't actually notice, of course, having a bad chest, I suppose.  I'd obviously burnt the inside of my throat and top of my windpipe.  Because as I was shoving everything out the window and running around like a dervish, of course, I was breathing in the burning smoke, which you don't think about.  

Speaker 0: Well, I didn't think about it.  But I was just...  

Speaker 1: I was beside myself at one stage.  I mean, I've never seen myself like it, ever.  Never known myself behave like that.  Like what?  At one stage, I was on my knees, curled up in a ball, with my head down on my knees, just sobbing at what an idiot I was.  How could I be so stupid?  

Speaker 0: Stupid to have let the fire happen or stupid to have behaved the way you did?  

Speaker 1: No, stupid to have let the fire happen.  And I'm embarrassed about the fact that I made, you know, such a, not drama, but I just was so vocal outside, I guess.  

Speaker 0: So what bothered you most?  

Speaker 1: The fact that you let the fire happen in the first place or the fact that you responded in the way you did?  

Speaker 0: Well, in a peculiar way, that's a sort of double-edged sword, because part of me is, in a peculiar way, not grateful for the fire, but it taught me an incredibly valuable lesson.  And I got off very lightly, considering what could have happened.  So in some respects I'm grateful that it taught me a very valuable, it also taught several neighbours a lesson because they'd never seen fire spread that fast either.  But any intelligent person knows how stupid it is to put a candle that far from a voile curtain.  And what's the, you know, what does it mean to you that you did that?  

Speaker 1: It means that I knew it was stupid.  The thing is, I knew it was stupid.  I knew it was stupid.  I knew it was risky.  

Speaker 0: But I'll tell you what it is, is it was, I thought I knew better.  

Speaker 1: And that's what's made me angry.  What makes me feel is that I'm that bloody clever, that I can be.  you know,  

Speaker 0: it would set  

Speaker 1: on fire for other people, but not for me, what gives me the right,  

Speaker 0: that's what  

Speaker 1: I'm frustrated about, I think, is what gives me the right to feel that I knew better than what is general fire advice, don't put a candle near bloody curtains, because I've done it many times, I light candles nearly every day, and many times I've done it, you know, and there's been a bit  

Speaker 0: of a breeze, and I've seen  

Speaker 1: the net move, and You know, but  

Speaker 0: usually it's just there  

Speaker 1: and I'm here, you know.  

Speaker 0: But what gave me the right to think that I knew better than, you know, what firemen tell you you shouldn't do?  So if we think over the past few days, you know, is there a bit of point in time where you've sort of felt, you know, at your worst or you've noticed that you've felt, you know, more ashamed or more down.  

Speaker 1: The second day after it, not the first day after it happened, the second day after it happened on the Saturday, I was extremely tearful, just continually tears for a few minutes and I'd get over it, then tears for a few minutes.  And I think... In a way I acknowledge that that was probably my way of dealing with the shock of it and in some respects I thought well at least if you get it out now, I would hate to have some sort of post-traumatic shock in the future.  

Speaker 0: I think I have actually dealt with the trauma side of it.  So once you've dealt with the trauma side of it, you said that you've had times where you've been critical of yourself.  

Speaker 1: Yes.  

Speaker 0: Can you think of a particular time where you've been doing that?  Always when I'm on my own, either sitting in the bath or sitting in my chair.  What does that do to your mood?  What happens?  It makes me put myself down.  So how does it make you feel when you're doing that?  Like an idiot.  Okay, so you think you're an idiot, but how does it make you feel emotionally?  Emotionally.  And when you feel pathetic, how does that feel?  Does it make you feel sad?  I can't answer that.  I don't know.  

Speaker 1: It's a feeling on its own for you, is it?  Why did I have to make such a big fuss about it?  With all the shrieks, screams and shouting outside.  I almost felt like Afterwards, like, well, did you want an audience?  That was what I felt like afterwards.  Did you want everyone to see that?  Because believe me, everyone was... Because I lived on the bottom of a... Everybody was on the railing with the fire engines up on the road, all hanging over, you know, like that, watching it.  

Speaker 0: Watching me screaming my head off.  OK.  So hold that thought.  Mm-hm.  Can I just take this opportunity to explain a thought diary?  Because, you know, I wonder if we can use this to try and sort of look at your experience and sort of think about some of the questions that you're asking yourself, all right?  

Speaker 1: Yeah.  

Speaker 0: The idea, you know, one of the big ideas, you know, there's a few big ideas in CBT, but one of the big ideas in CBT is that, you know, the way we think about things has a massive effect on how we feel, on how we behave, and, you know, how we feel physically, you know, the vicious circle, yeah?  And so what it suggests is that when people are depressed or they're anxious, people are much more likely to think in worried or depressed ways.  One of the ideas is that it becomes more of a pattern, a more habitual thing that we do.  And when we're feeling down, it's almost like we've got a filter on.  in front of us and only the stuff that sort of supports the gloomy way that we see ourselves and everything else sort of comes through that filter, all the other stuff sort of bounces off.  Oh, I buy that, yeah.  Yeah, and it just keeps permanently reinforcing these sort of more gloomy ideas.  Now, the other idea that it has is that, you know, when we're depressed we're more likely to interpret situations in a more negative way.  So a situation may happen And we will make sense of that in a much more negative way than somebody that's not feeling so depressed would.  Because it's more in line with how we're feeling inside and how we're feeling about ourself.  So what we try and do in CBT is say, well, okay, if thoughts are quite important, and the idea that one situation could happen and we could think about that in one of two ways really, one a really sort of negative way, Is it possible to look at this same situation in a less negative way?  that might lead to us feeling a bit better and behaving in a different way?  Yeah.  

Speaker 1: I mean, I can see, like I said, I saw part of the best of me.  I can see that if I hadn't have reacted the way that I did, I know it would have been a much, much bigger fire.  And I am quite proud of that fact.  It didn't cross my mind that I had household insurance and it would all be covered.  I just wanted to thank God that my daughter and grandson, whatever, weren't in there.  You know, so I can sort of see that positive side of it, but I can't see it positive to me screaming like a dervish.  

Speaker 0: Okay.  

Speaker 1: And that's the thought, you know, because, you know, the fact that you scream like a dervish then, you know, what's the worst bit about that for you?  The worst bit about that is, I guess, is a problem.  normal thought that people have or if maybe my thoughts on that are stronger than others.  But I was told I was an idiot for so many years.  

Speaker 0: And that's where thought diaries come in.  The way we make sense of situations can be influenced by our depression and the way we feel about ourselves.  And that brings me to the second big idea about CBT.  What's CBT?  we've got kind of automatic thoughts, okay?  And within specific situations, specific thoughts can be triggered, you know, so, you know, people think I'm an idiot or, you know, I can't believe I did that, you know, and they can be quite sort of negative in content, all right?  And the idea is, is that, you know, these types of thoughts tend to sort of fit into these sort of unhelpful thinking styles, which, you know, researchers... sort of suggests that people, when they're depressed, you know, they slip into these types of kind of thinking starts much more frequently than you do when you're not depressed.  We all do this, depressed or not depressed, but the research seems to suggest that when we are depressed, we do it much, much more.  Yeah, that would make sense.  Right.  And that, you know, these negative thoughts... are generated from more sort of fundamental rules that we have about ourselves.  Okay?  Which it sounds like you're sort of starting to talk about.  And these rules are sort of generated from our, you know, our experiences.  Okay?  Our childhood and things that have happened to us.  So, rules that, I mean, you've talked about, you know, you've talked about themes of thinking that you've had about, you know, worrying about what people think of you.  People are going to think if you sort of slip up, people are going to think you're a bit of an idiot, you know, and if you're not on top of things, you know, you're weak and you talk quite a lot about, you know, feeling that you have to be, you know, always in control, otherwise it means you're  

Speaker 1: a weak person and if anybody is sort of vulnerable, if you're vulnerable in any way, then that means you're weak.  Yes, and I do believe that quite firmly, yes.  

Speaker 0: Okay, so you've got... So what the model would suggest is that these sort of rules and these ideas come from, you know, your experiences, the things that have happened to you in your life, that you make sense of them.  You make sense of the world, you make sense of yourself, and you make sense of other people from all the things that have happened to you in your lives.  And you generate these rules, you know, if I'm vulnerable then I'm weak, you know.  And what the model sort of says is that, you know, these are sort of silent rules.  They're unspoken rules.  We often have no idea that they're there.  You know, but they are.  And part of therapy is about trying to find these rules, okay, and having a look at them.  And once they're on the table, then you can say, well, you know, I can kind of see where that came from.  But it gives you the opportunity to have a look at them and say, well, okay, you know, this is a rule that you believe.  You know, how helpful is this to you?  You know, do you want to keep it?  Is it serving you a purpose?  Is it rational?  And if the answer to that is no, then it's about what would you like to live by?  What would be a more rational, more helpful, more useful rule to have?  Because what we believe is we learn these rules through our lifetime, therefore we can unlearn them and we can learn new ones.  That's what I'd like.  I genuinely hope that that is true.  Okay.  And so because these rules exist, they're sort of more global.  They sit across lots of our experiences and, you know, lots of the situations that happen to us.  What happens is when situations come up that sort of are consistent with that, we get a lot of these negative thoughts.  

Speaker 1: You know, so if you have a rule around not being weak and then you're in a situation and you behave in a way that you're not happy with, you know, you will get the thoughts true.  It reinforces my feelings of weakness about myself.  

Speaker 0: I'm with you.  Yeah, yeah.  So what we do first is we try and look for these.  We try and look at whether these sort of unhelpful, negative thoughts are popping up.  And it's about saying, well, okay, let's have a look at that thought then.  You know, is this thought absolutely a hundred and ten percent factual?  You know, is it that this is the only way we can see this situation?  That this thought, there's no room, you know, no room for doubt.  This room is fact.  This thought is fact.  Because if we think about this sort of vicious circle model... with thoughts, moods, behaviour and physicality.  So what we're saying is all these things are interlinked.  

Speaker 1: So if we have a thought, I'm weak, how does that make you feel?  How does that make you behave?  And does that affect your biological self?  

Speaker 0: So if we're working on the idea, I'm weak, how do we know that that's actually true?  

Speaker 1: Could there be another way of looking at that situation?  Well, this is where I struggle, you see, because I know that I'm, it sounds self-contradictory, because I know that if I was looking at somebody else in my shoes, that I wouldn't see them like that.  And that's what I can't seem to adjust.  

Speaker 0: Okay.  And that's exactly what this is for.  Right.  This is why we teach the skill of a thought diary, because it gives you the opportunity to do exactly what you're talking about, to have a look at that thought on face value and say, well, okay, I believe this at the time.  But is this the only way to think about this?  You know, is there, you know, what's the evidence behind this thing?  What's the evidence to suggest that this is true?  You know, we look at all of that and we exhaust all of that.  And then we try and look at, well, what's the evidence to suggest that's not true?  And one of the strategies we use is, you know, put yourself in the position, if this was somebody else, what would you be saying to them?  You know, because often what we realise is, as people we tend to give very good advice to other people.  yes yes sometimes we're less able to.  you know take that advice for ourselves and we have different standards for other people than we would have for ourself and it's about it's about just trying to.  you know.  look at the discrepancy sometimes between you know how we judge ourselves and how we judge other people and say well okay is that fair?  you know you're treating yourself fairly Or is this quite an unfair way to sort of behave towards yourself?  I've never thought about whether or not I treat myself fairly.  I don't suppose most people would have that as a conscious thought, would they?  Well, I guess what we're going to try and do is have a look at how it's working for you.  Because the idea is that this stuff is instant.  We're in a situation, we feel a certain way.  Often we don't even know the thoughts that are ticking through our heads.  We just feel the way we feel.  This is really, really quick stuff.  

Speaker 1: It's automatic.  

Speaker 0: And we're just trying to slow it down, get a massive magnifying glass out and have a look at it and say, well, okay, what is happening here?  Is this what you want?  Is it fair?  Is it the only way to think about it?  Or is there, you know, could it be that, you know, you're slightly biased in the way that you're interpreting this situation against yourself?  And in the midst of that... I've got to be able to believe it.  

Speaker 1: I don't know whether I'm going to struggle with that because it is so ingrained in me.  Certainly, I'm open to any idea.  I just hope that I can shift that because it is so deep-rooted, that pathetic sort of...  

Speaker 0: Okay.  So how about we have a look at this and we have a go?  Yeah, I'm game for it all.  So really, what we tend to find... when we do this, is by the process of writing it down is actually quite helpful in itself.  You know, it's a key skill that we try and teach in this therapy, okay?  Because if you can get this, then it can be quite helpful.  Because the idea behind CBT is this essentially is a self-help model, you know?  What we're doing is we're teaching you some skills and strategies that you can use for the rest of your life.  Yeah.  Okay?  And by writing this down, it often gives people... the opportunity to be much more objective.  You know, people say, well, you know, I do this in my head.  But it's about actually sitting down and sort of using these forms and getting yourself...  

Speaker 1: You can have it in stages.  

Speaker 0: Yeah, absolutely.  And making yourself try and exhaust the questions, you know.  Right.  Because what people are very good at is finding the evidence to support their thoughts.  Because, you know, that's what you think.  

Speaker 1: Yes.  

Speaker 0: What often is harder is finding the evidence that doesn't support your thoughts, you know.  And that's the bit that people really need to try and sort of practice.  okay any new skill.  a lot of people can struggle with this and they can find it really hard.  they're not easy things to do.  this isn't a natural way to think but it's about you know just being patient with it keeping having a go and you know i'm here to sort of help you as much as i can to try and get your head around this.  okay but a lot of people struggle with this.  okay all right i'll give it a go okay So we use three main forms.  One is, you know, this is almost like the crib, so it's the questions to ask yourself.  So what we're doing with the thought diagrams, we're looking at it so that it always is specific to a situation.  So something's happened where you notice your mood has changed.  Or whether you're noticing that you're thinking particularly gloomily, but you would probably notice that your mood has changed also if you're having those types of thoughts.  So we often, you know, what I'll be doing is saying, you know, has there been a time in the week where you've noticed your mood shift or you've not felt so good?  And so then what we do is we write down the situation.  So we say, well, okay, let's have a look at what's going on there.  So the things we will be thinking, you know, in detail is where am I?  What's the time?  What's the place?  You know, who are the people?  What's the event that's just happened that has, you know, happened before you've noticed your mood change?  

Speaker 1: So what's... So I'm going to be listening this time.  I'm taking this with me.  

Speaker 0: Well... we always do this together.  

Speaker 1: first yeah but you you don't want me to remember everything.  i mean i can take this away to write down.  

Speaker 0: yeah yeah yeah of course you can.  yeah yeah so this will be yours right.  but these are the questions where i start off with.  you know what is what is what's just happened before?  you've noticed your mood shift okay and then the next bit is about saying well okay well what am i feeling?  what is the mood?  so you write you list you you know you define the mood okay.  So am I feeling low, sad, guilty, worried, tense, anxious, panicky?  You know, what is the feeling?  And state the feelings clearly.  You know, and if there's more than one feeling happening, you know, write each feeling down.  Okay.  And then the next bit you'll do is you'll write how powerful that feeling is.  You know, how strongly do you feel it?  You know, you're only feeling it a little bit or you're feeling it a lot.  So we tend to use a nought to a hundred percent ratio.  Okay.  So nought is you're not feeling it until a hundred.  It's really intense.  Mm-hmm.  And then the next bit, which can be quite tricky, is you're saying, well, okay, at the time when I'm feeling this, what exactly is going through my mind?  So what are the thoughts?  Okay, so we try and sort of pinpoint those thoughts.  And then what we try and do is come up with what's called the hottest thought.  The thought that feels most powerful to you.  You know, the thought that's most uncomfortable, most upsetting, whatever it is, but the thought that really is powerful.  the most prominent for you, and then we have a look at that.  So what we do is we underline the one that sort of feels the hottest, and then we relate your belief in it at the time.  So how much do you believe that thought?  Okay.  Okay, again, naught to a hundred.  And then what we try and do is have a little think about, well, when you think about it, when you think in this way and you have that thought, is that helpful to you?  How does that affect how you behave or what you do?  Does it have any effect at all?  Why might this be a problem thinking in this way?  And that's the first bit that we're going to try and have a go at.  Okay, I can make sense of that.  Then the second bit, after we've done this, the second bit that we're going to is say, well, okay, this is a thought.  It's not helpful.  You know, it might be helpful if I thought about it in a different way.  And this is where we come onto the evidence.  So we look at that thought and say, well, okay, what's the evidence to support that thought if you believe it quite strongly?  And is there anything to suggest that this might not be a hundred percent true?  Because often what you'll find with these thoughts is sometimes, you know, It can be completely accurate, what you're thinking, and it's a real problem, and we need to think about that problem, and we can come up with ways that you can try and problem-solve it.  Or it may be that actually there's only a tiny grain of truth in that thought, but you're believing it really strongly.  Blowing it out of proportion.  Okay, and so we try and look at the evidence on both sides, and then come up with a more balanced conclusion that you can tell yourself.  Okay.  That takes in both sides of your arguments, rather than just being one-sided.  which is usually sort of a much more negative interpretation of what's happened.  

Speaker 1: Right.  Now, on there, would I list also, or is this nothing to do with panic attacks?  Because here we have situation.  I'm just wondering, because, you know, here I am, let's say, half asleep in front of the TV, and then wham, the adrenaline starts pumping.  Am I putting that down?  Or am I not?  Is panic attacks something completely separate?  

Speaker 0: Well, you know, you can put that down.  I mean, what I would say is we'd fill the first one out together so that we give you an experience of how to use a thought diary.  I don't expect you just to go away and do this on your own.  Oh, okay.  All right.  You know, usually, unless you particularly want to do that, generally I try and do one with somebody first.  

Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think it would be valuable for me to take it home because I won't see you for another week because I know I'm dreading something that's happening tomorrow.  next week after i see you i have to go through a whole body mri scan and be sedated for it later in the day.  

Speaker 0: um i'd like to have a go of it.  

Speaker 1: i'll say it yeah because of course the other thing being on morphine my short-term memory is crap as well.  well that's fine.  not necessarily remember everything.  

Speaker 0: we've got ten minutes left today.  how would you feel about trying to just have a stab at it with some of the thoughts that you've had about yourself since the fire.  Okay.  Yeah?  Would that be okay?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Right.  So, when I asked you earlier, so thinking about this, you know, think about since you said you got over the original trauma and then since then you've felt quite, you've had periods where you've felt quite ashamed.  Is there a situation that's particularly clear in your mind where you've noticed that you've been feeling quite ashamed?  

Speaker 1: There is.  It was set out on my steps.  Um, and the fireman, me, the fireman pinching the oxygen thing on my nose and me yanking it off and going, yes, but I'm so stupid and just screaming, you idiot, you effing idiot and all that.  And the fact that I knew that people were there, but I guess I couldn't control what I was actually doing.  Um, It's just I feel a little bit like I've only lived there a few weeks.  I don't even know these people yet.  

Speaker 0: I mean, one of my immediate neighbours, it's a semi-bungalow.  

Speaker 1: There's two bungalows.  And the other lady, she also has emphysema.  And she came out and she said to one of the firemen, the previous tenant was eighty-two who left here.  She said, I thought I'd be safe with a bloody young'un.  You know.  

Speaker 0: Okay.  So last Saturday then was when you felt, you can remember feeling quite ashamed.  And where were you when that was happening?  

Speaker 1: I probably would have been sitting in my chair or sitting in the bath.  Actually, I was mooching around miserable all day.  I wouldn't let anybody bring friends around.  

Speaker 0: Was there a particular point in that day when you noticed?  

Speaker 1: The whole day.  The whole day.  I was up and down all day.  

Speaker 0: Can you think about a particular point in that day when you felt at your worst?  Yes, when I was sitting in the bath.  You were sitting in the bath, okay.  So if we use this as our crib then, think in detail.  

Speaker 1: Where am I?  What am I doing?  

Speaker 0: Okay, so we're writing this down now, yes.  Okay, so I'm in the bath.  Okay.  Okay.  Can you remember what time of the day it was?  

Speaker 1: It would have been probably early afternoon.  

Speaker 0: Okay.  So here at that time?  Yeah.  

Speaker 1: So let's say it was about three o'clock.  Okay.  Okay.  And you're on your own, yeah, in the bath?  Yes, yeah.  My own in the bath.  Some people are.  

Speaker 0: Well, no, this is true.  I can't presume.  So the events, you know, what has happened, what has been said before, you know, you started feeling it?  

Speaker 1: Actually, part of the reason I'd gone into the bath, I'd gone and had a bath, was because I knew I could shut myself away in the bathroom.  Because my youngest daughter was in and out.  And she'd seen me tear up a couple of times.  And, of course, you know, they're bound to be protective and supportive.  And she's going, oh, don't worry about it, Mum.  And I was apologising to my daughters for it as well.  

Speaker 0: Okay.  So there'd been a fire a few days earlier.  Yeah.  And you were saying that you'd just taken yourself to the bath.  

Speaker 1: Yeah.  

Speaker 0: Because you'd... Like this here as well?  Yeah.  

Speaker 1: I was doing it out in the... I was going out in the garden and all sorts the whole day, really.  Right.  And why was it?  

Speaker 0: you actually took yourself to the bathroom then?  So you could be sad on your own?  

Speaker 1: So that I could cry on my own without my daughter seeing me, yeah.  Put this here.  

Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.  Why didn't you want your daughter to see you?  Did you feel ashamed?  

Speaker 1: No, because it upsets her to see me crying.  

Speaker 0: Okay.  Okay, so... It's always remembering with these, it's about being specific, okay?  And it's about a specific point in time.  

Speaker 1: I need to keep this, don't I?  So that I can see the detail I'm putting into this.  

Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.  So at this time then, when you're at the bath, in your bath, how are you feeling?  

Speaker 1: I'm feeling just... upset and I think I was probably still a bit shocked, you know, because it only happened at five on a Thursday.  

Speaker 0: Okay, so you were feeling upset and shocked.  

Speaker 1: I was upset and traumatised.  I suppose is the word, a bit traumatised, only a little bit, you know.  

Speaker 0: And were you also feeling ashamed at that point?  

Speaker 1: Probably, yeah.  Okay, so we write these down here.  

Speaker 0: What was the other thing?  Ashamed.  Okay, so again here, this is what's telling us what to do.  So it's saying, you know, you altered emotion and physical feelings at the time.  You know, was I feeling any of these feelings or others?  And state clearly and try and be as precise as possible.  If there's more than one feeling that's occurring, try and underline the most powerful feeling at the time.  

Speaker 1: So out of these... That was the most...  

Speaker 0: Okay.  That one.  Okay, so how powerful is this feeling, sort of nought to a hundred?  Nought is, you know, you don't feel ashamed at all, a hundred.  you feel really ashamed.  Okay, so fairly ashamed.  And the other bit it asks you is, you know, were there any particular sort of strong physical sensations that you noticed at the time that you sort of felt this?  Or was it mainly...  

Speaker 1: No, I couldn't stop myself tearing up throughout the whole day, you know, so I was crying, which... Is this here?  

Speaker 0: Yeah.  OK, you're crying.  All right.  So the next bit is asking us, you know, OK, so when you were feeling this, you know, what were you thinking?  So what thoughts were present at the time?  So, you know, the prompts it's got here is, you know, what's going through your mind?  Is you thinking about yourself in a particular way or thinking about how other people think about you?  What are you thinking about the situation?  Are you worried about what might happen in the future?  What exactly were the thoughts that were going through your head?  

Speaker 1: There was a mixture of thoughts, but the main negative thought was that I'd been so stupid to let it happen.  And also the other negative thought was was how dare I feel what made me think that I knew better than fire safety advice.  

Speaker 0: Okay.  So do you want to write those down?  The trick here is... It was me, I kicked something.  All right.  The trick here is what you've got to try and do is write your thoughts down as they went through your head.  

Speaker 1: Okay.  

Speaker 0: So exactly sort of word for word that it flew through your head.  You know, was it that you... You know, for example, some people say, oh, I was thinking that they thought this about me.  Whereas, you know, was that actually the thought in your head?  or was the thought in your head?  they think this?  You know, they think I am.  Can you see the difference I'm saying?  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  So, I. Yeah.  

Speaker 1: So when you were feeling your most ashamed, were there any other thoughts that were going through your mind?  Apart from, you know, how could I be so stupid?  What brought me out of it was the other thought that came out of my mind, which was the knowledge that I'd actually stopped it from becoming something far more serious.  And I know it sounds daft, but I am quite proud of the fact that Because if I'd done what they advised you to do, if I'd just legged it, I would have ended up losing half the bungalow.  

Speaker 0: So we'll come back to that.  But in terms of thoughts that seemed to sort of sit with the more negative feelings that you were having, were there any other thoughts that were going through your mind?  

Speaker 1: At that particular time, I wasn't thinking.  I wasn't worrying about what the neighbours thought about me crying.  I suppose another negative thought is, are my kids always going to have to spend the rest of their lives wondering what trouble I'm going to get into next?  Do my kids really need any more drama from me?  I mean, you know, I'd only been rushed up to Southmead the day before.  

Speaker 0: OK.  So, write that down, yeah?  Mm-hm.  So was that the thought, do my kids need more drama?  Yeah, do my kids need this all the time?  

Speaker 1: I told you when I first met you, I seem to court controversy wherever I go.  

Speaker 0: So was there a follow-up to that sort of thought?  You know, if we look at the crib here, you know, then it's about saying, you know, is there something about how you see yourself where you're worrying about how others see you?  Because was it just, do my kids need more drama, or were you thinking about what your kids might think about you, or the drama that you see that you'd caused?  

Speaker 1: Both.  Both things, to be perfectly honest.  

Speaker 0: So what were the thoughts, what was going through your mind about that?  Partly, the thoughts were, They've got their own issues with college.  

Speaker 1: The last thing they need is more drama from me.  But also there's a part of me, I think, that probably feels, are they going to end up always worrying about me?  Because I don't want that.  I would hate to be one of those people that are in wheelchairs that have their children.  

Speaker 0: I'd rather top myself than have my kids looking after me.  Okay.  So do these seem to be the main thoughts that were going through your mind at the time?  Yes.  And out of these thoughts, which would you say...  

Speaker 1: Which was the most intense of these three?  I suppose these two sort of really amalgamate into one.  How could I be so stupid and think I knew better?  So I guess they're one, really.  That's the main thought, yes.  

Speaker 0: So underline it.  Okay.  And so what this asks us to do next, and he's right how strongly you believe this thought, nought to a hundred, at the time.  So nought you didn't believe it, a hundred you really believed it, you know.  Okay.  So was it, you know, how could I be so stupid?  

Speaker 1: That was the main thing, and how could you be so pompous to think that you know better than whatever.  

Speaker 0: Okay, so how much did you believe that?  

Speaker 1: Well, I believed I'd been stupid, I guess.  So, oh, I believe that pretty blinking strongly.  Probably stronger than that.  So let's put ninety there.  

Speaker 0: So was the thought, you know, I'm stupid that I did this?  You know, because I guess what's the worst thing about thinking, you know, what was the worst beat about the idea that you could have been so stupid?  

Speaker 1: That I could... trust in my own judgment  

Speaker 0: because  

Speaker 1: I mean the bottom line is it was my  

Speaker 0: fault and I knew  

Speaker 1: the back door was open I knew the candle was by a curtain and I the big me thought but because it's me and because it's my house and my candle it won't catch on fire it won't happen to me that way it won't happen to me syndrome I guess is what I'm pointing  

Speaker 0: out okay.  

Speaker 1: so And the truth is it did happen to me.  

Speaker 0: Was there a thought going through your head, this is my fault then?  

Speaker 1: Oh, well it was my fault.  

Speaker 0: Right, okay.  So was that another thought that was kicking around when this was going on, this is my fault?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yes.  Okay.  And the fact that it was your fault, you saw it to be your fault, what was the worst bit about that?  Um... I don't know how to answer that.  

Speaker 1: What was the worst part about feeling it?  It was my fault.  It was my phone buzzing in my pocket.  I was just more stupid, I guess.  

Speaker 0: Okay.  And so, the thought is, you know, this was my fault, I'm stupid.  Right, okay, so it's still, you know, along these lines, isn't it?  Okay, so you believed it quite strongly, you know, this is my fault and I'm stupid and pompous that I'd done it.  Okay.  So, the next bit that it, we'll miss this bit for a sec, the next bit that it asks you is by thinking in this way, you know, did it have any effect on, you know, what you did?  You know, did you do anything differently?  In the sense of, you know, did it affect how you behaved?  Did you avoid people or situations or did you engage in any sort of unhelpful behaviours to you?  

Speaker 1: I got absolutely stoned out of my head.  Okay.  Okay.  

Speaker 0: Can't be more honest than that, can you?  All right then.  What was the impact that it had on?  or did it have any impact on you or your view of others or how you felt or what you said or what you did?  

Speaker 1: and overall was this a helpful way to think?  It's not a helpful way to think but I think looking back on it, it was part of me coming to terms with what had happened.  So quite possibly it was helpful.  I mean, I had to take ownership for it.  

Speaker 0: But the fact that you're sat in the bar ruminating on this, feeling so ashamed, is that helpful?  

Speaker 1: Well, it'll stop me doing it again.  Right, okay.  So in that respect, yeah.  

Speaker 0: Okay.  So what were you so ashamed about, though?  Because, you know, it's like you could be annoyed with yourself that you accidentally set a fire and wound up about that.  

Speaker 1: Well, perhaps annoyed is the word.  

Speaker 0: But what were you so ashamed about?  

Speaker 1: Because I know I'm not a stupid person.  Hmm.  

Speaker 0: And I behaved stupidly, that's what I was ashamed about, I guess.  And ashamed that I obviously believed that it wouldn't happen to me.  But did you think that at the time, or was that your interpretation of it afterwards?  

Speaker 1: Oh no, afterwards, no, I didn't think it at the time, yeah.  I mean, what was also going on at the same time was I was trying to rationalise it, saying to myself, but on the other hand, because of how he reacted, you know, You stopped a major calamity.  And it did teach me and others an extremely valuable lesson.  

Speaker 0: Okay.  So do you still feel stupid that you did that?  Do you think that means that you're stupid?  

Speaker 1: I don't think it means I'm stupid.  I think it's a very stupid thing to do.  And I don't like the fact that I did something so stupid.  

Speaker 0: Okay, so the instance of this, you know, diary that we've done here, you know, what we've done is we've looked at this situation, we've looked at sort of how that's made you feel, and the type of thoughts that seem to relate to those feelings, okay?  Now, it might be that, you know, in this example, that actually, you know, you were quite annoyed with yourself that you'd done this, you had made a mistake, there was a consequence to that, you managed that, you know, you managed how you felt by getting quite stoned, you know, but the original thought, you know, that maybe it was a silly thing to do, and, you know, you would do something differently.  Yes.  What I'm curious about is this ashamed bit, and I wondered, you know, if we had a bit more time, whether we could sort of try and unpick that a bit more.  I think ashamed probably comes in more to do with the screaming out in there, you know.  Yeah, I mean, that's my guess.  Yeah.  And I think if we sort of looked at the thoughts around that, we would kind of get, you know, we'd get to sort of really, you know, whether there are any... Hello?  So what we're looking for in a thought diary is, does this match?  Do these thoughts seem to match the feelings?  Because often we're not aware of these thoughts.  We're just aware of this.  Human beings, often we're emotion-driven.  That's what tends to catch our attention, is how we feel.  So the fact that you felt so ashamed, the thoughts that you were reporting that you're having, to me... don't seem to match.  You're saying you don't seem... So I think if we have another go at this diary and actually look at, well, what are the thoughts around, you know, your behaviour then?  Yeah, let me just make it as simple as possible.  It's the wrong word.  

Speaker 1: It's not a duplicable word.  

Speaker 0: Do you get a sense of, you know, how these operate?  Yes, yes.  So do you want to have a go at trying to do one over the week?  

Speaker 1: I would like to take one or even two of these with me because my memory is so rubbish.  

Speaker 0: So just to give me an idea, could you sort of try and tell me what you think the point of that is?  

Speaker 1: Just so I can be clear about whether I've explained it very well or not.  I think the point of this is for me to understand that my thought processes are actually working for me negatively.  

Speaker 0: and I need to start turning around to work for me in a positive manner.  Okay.  Is that right?  Yeah, and the idea that we can... Well, I hope it doesn't feel like that.  

Speaker 1: No, it doesn't.  

Speaker 0: The idea that we can view a situation in different ways.  You know, the classic example we use in CBT is, you know, you go to a party, you're chatting away to somebody, and then all of a sudden they look over your shoulder.  And you think, am I being boring, or did someone catch their eye?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  And the idea is that when we feel quite depressed, we're more likely to think, I'm being boring, it's something about me.  Whereas it may be the most drop-dead gorgeous person who just walks in the room and they're just gobsmacked.  And actually, if we thought that, would that make us feel better?  

Speaker 1: Rather than thinking, oh, I'm boring, this is about me.  Funny what you said earlier about how we can see it in others.  Because I can advise my girls, you know, when one of them say, oh, that... girl that tip me funny and I say no she's probably just deep in thought.  I can make sense of it for my kids.  

Speaker 0: so we happy to sort of leave that there then.  and um yeah exactly just give me a.

MESSAGE assistant """
The CTS-R scores for the transcript reflect a moderate engagement in several therapy areas but show room for improvement in others. Here's an organized summary based on the analysis:

1. **AGENDA SETTING & ADHESION (2/6):** The therapist didn't fully engage with the client's initial idea about their role, leading to limited adherence.

2. **FEEDBACK (1/6):** Minimal feedback was given by the therapist, resulting in low scores for this criterion.

3. **COLLABORATION (2/6):** Some back-and-forth occurred, but it was one-sided from the client's side, indicating partial collaboration.

4. **PACING & EFFICIENT USE OF TIME (2/6):** The conversation could have been more concise to avoid unnecessary repetition and digression.

5. **INTERPERSONAL EFFECTIVENESS (2/6):** The interaction lacked depth; the therapist could enhance engagement with clearer emotional cues or empathy.

6. **ELICITING APPROPRIATE EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION (3/6):** The client expressed feelings, though they were vague and not deeply explored.

7. **ELICITING KEY COGNITIONS (3/6):** Some cognitive identification occurred but was underexplored regarding the root cause of the mistake.

8. **ELICITING BEHAVIOURS (3/6):** The client reflected on their behavior but didn't link it deeply to future prevention strategies.

9. **GUIDED DISCOVERY (2/6):** Limited guidance provided; deeper exploration of habits and patterns was needed.

10. **CONCEPTUAL INTEGRATION (2/6):** CBT concepts were mentioned without clear application, leading to abstract understanding.

11. **APPLICATION OF CHANGE METHODS (1/6):** No specific steps or resources were suggested for behavior or thinking change.

12. **HOMEWORK SETTING (3/6):** Insufficient follow-up questions or tasks were assigned; no concrete homework was provided.

In conclusion, the transcript demonstrated some efforts in addressing the issue but lacked depth in feedback, collaboration, and practical application. The therapist could enhance engagement by providing more specific emotional expression, key cognitions, and homework tasks to foster deeper change.
